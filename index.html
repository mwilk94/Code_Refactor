        <div>
            <p> My name is Merkisha Wilkinson, and I am a student currently enrolled in the Full Stack Flex Bootcamp Program at  the University of Pennsylvania. Previously, I pursued a degree in education hoping to find myself within the program. During that time I also obtained my certification in Medical Billing and Coding and started a small tutoring business. I had yet to finish my degree and was working over-time as a technical support agent for Apple. There, my love for technology evolved. I wanted to know so much more about the devices I serviced. I started to fall in love with problem solving, critcal thinking, and helping others. I spent some time in my position making my way up to a Senior Advisor, where I worked hand in hand with developers to solve customer issues. Intrigued with the developers prowess, I decided to research "what is a software developer". There was so much information on Google, Youtube, Instagram and Tiktok! There are so many possibilities and I am so excited to be creative and  add new skills under my belt!</p>
